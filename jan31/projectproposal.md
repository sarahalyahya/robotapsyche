# Initial Project Proposal
## The Role of Robots and AI in Mental Health 

While I was looking through various articles, I stumbled upon a [feature](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/06/robo-therapy) by the American Psychology Association about "bubblebot," a robot designed to help children on the autism spectrum develop social skills. A bunch of other articles referenced the usage of AI to develop counseling applications, help the elderly with dementia...etc. So, I decided to explore this in my project. I still feel like my topic can be narrowed down, which I feel like will happen when I read more of the resources in depth and consider some of the questions I have, such as:

* Can the involvement of AI in therapy and psychiatry help break the taboo of mental health support in some socities? 
* Remembering Weizenbaum's ELIZA, how can we program robots that not only "simulate" understanding and empathy, but are actually empathetic? 
* Are there possible threats with allowing robots into this field? Especially with regards to privacy and confidentiality?
