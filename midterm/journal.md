# Midterm Project - Stronger Together
## Brainstorming - Feb 28
Right now, I'm still brainstorming approaches to finetune my code, particularly to transform the uniform community of preys that I have to a more diverse community with different characteristics, i.e. how could different members of a community behave differently to achieve the same end goal, which is to overthrow the predator, or the "dictator".
So my next steps are:
- Debug the code and make the current interaction more visible by possibly slowing it down
- make the creature DNAs more "intentional" in the sense that more thought is put into each value, and behaviors are better modeled and grouped together
- add additional interactions which could include "killing" the predator and the emergence of a new predator WITHIN the group of preys


## Tweaking Assignment 1 - March 3
On March 3rd, after meeting with the professor, I worked on tweaking the values of velocity and mass in my first assignment, to avoid the extreme increase in velocity that is evident in assignment one. This made possible a more natural interaction between the circular elements (citizens/ revolutionaries)

## Replacing Attraction with Seek, and Adding Shelter - March 7
On March 7th, I worked on the forces between the dictator and revolutionaries, replacing all attraction and repulsion forces with seek and flee. I also implemented the shelter and barred the dictator from entering it

## Suggestions from Peers - March 9
During class, we were split into breakout rooms where we gave eachother tweaks and suggestions. A classmate suggested the idea of including an elite/ruling class and I thought that it was brilliant! So I scratched any other plans and I had in mind and adopted that as my plan. I started working on the elite class and drafting the possible interactions that could occur between them and the revolutionaries. 

## Finish up code, comments, debug, and document - March 11
Today, I finished all the code and then spent a few hours debugging and dealing with glitches. I would say they weren't resolved perfectly, but the difference between the moment the glitch emerged and what I have now is significant. I then cleaned and commented the code and wrote my documentation. For my documentation, I took screenshots, pictures of my notes, and designed a small graphic to explain my program components.
