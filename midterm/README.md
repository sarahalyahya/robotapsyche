# Midterm Project - Stronger Together
## Brainstorming
Right now, I'm still brainstorming approaches to finetune my code, particularly to transform the uniform community of preys that I have to a more diverse community with different characteristics, i.e. how could different members of a community behave differently to achieve the same end goal, which is to overthrow the predator, or the "dictator".
So my next steps are:
- Debug the code and make the current interaction more visible by possibly slowing it down
- make the creature DNAs more "intentional" in the sense that more thought is put into each value, and behaviors are better modeled and grouped together
- add additional interactions which could include "killing" the predator and the emergence of a new predator WITHIN the group of preys
