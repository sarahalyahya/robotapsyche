## Idea & Planning
For my midterm assignment, I wanted to build on top of my first assignment. My idea initially was to simulate a system where citizens/revolutionaries stick together and grow stronger than the dictator. To add more elements and complexity to this version, I expanded a bit upon the ecosystem, adding a shelter for weak revolutionaries and an elite class. I also changed the visual cues for clarity. I'll delve into more detail about each component, but here's a snap shot from my planning process, and a graphic explaining the different states in the ecosystem.
