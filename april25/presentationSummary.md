# Overview

My presentation covered robots and their role in mental health services and wellbeing. This topic was inspired by my personal struggle in trying to think of accessible resources for myself, beyond traditional counseling, and then what would also be accessible to other disenfranchised communities. I wanted to ask, can robots be the solution that helps us promote emotional and mental wellbeing? 

# Preparation & Structure
I wanted to take a linear/historical approach to my presentation supported by a background of theory. So, I used Weizenbaum's 'Computer Power and Human Resources' to inform my questions and structure, and then presented the development of ideas of consciousness, language, and psychology within robotics. I engaged in citation mining to find my resources - going through artciles to lead me to other articles. 

# Discussion
A lot of valuable point came up in discussion, including what humans expects from their therapists, and hence what kind of expectations we would have from a robot therapist -- do we need a robot that just knows what to say? Or a robot with consciousness and human intelligence? We also discussed Natural Language Processers, such as GPT and the kind of datasets we could use in the training and development of such a tool. Finally, the disucssions following my presentation tied in perfectly and helped us continue the conversation throughout the entire class.
