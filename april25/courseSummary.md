# Course Summary 
To be honest, I was hesitant to sign up for this class last semester. Although I am an IM major, I didn’t feel like the topic of robotics has been that relevant in the context of my work outside the occasional article or artwork that I come across. Now, as the semester is coming to an end, I feel like this class has left me with a great sandbox of theoretical and practical concepts that I can use in the future. It also helped me better understand how crucial the conversations about the role of robots in our past, present, and future really are. In this summary, I will go over some of the concepts that stuck out to me and that I will probably revisit.  
## Practical Work
I really like Processing. That was one of the main reasons I wanted to join this class, as I felt like it would add another layer to my knowledge of this platform and its potential to create. Indeed, I think the practical material we covered has definitely opened my eyes to how much I could and haven’t been doing with Processing. Including the basic concepts of Physics was mostly simple but extremely powerful. It changed my perspective on how one can expand upon and challenge the tools they use! 


### When Software Mimics Nature
Although the material we covered was mainly meant to help us envision robotic systems as natural systems in the sense of natural phenomena such as flowing bodies of water or animal groups, I was fascinated by the possibilities of using these physical concepts to mimic complex human emotion and human behavior. Perhaps this was inspired by Braitenberg’s emotional machines, love, for example. 
I was particularly fascinated by the lectures where we discussed complexity, and how accumulated simplicity can achieve said complexity. Simulating behaviors such as competition, cohesion, and separation helped me envision my midterm project, where I reduced an extremely complex human phenomenon of revolution to basic geometric shapes. 


## Readings 
The course provides a solid historical foundation on some of the biggest conversations and debates in the world of robotics nowadays, which I really appreciated. Covering essential literature, like Asmiov, Braitenberg and Weizenbaum helped us construct a strong backdrop to cover the more contemporary works we looked at, such as ‘Do large language models understand us?’ (I really enjoyed this reading!) and Gunkel’s ‘The Machine Question’. 
Along with the balance of historical and modern works, the course readings also covered a range of media beyond just written works. For instance, we covered a couple of videos, series episodes, and films. In the future, I think it would be interesting to source and include other media forms such as artworks or games for example. 
Generally, the material provided a cohesive foundation where we leave understanding the past context of the course material but also understanding present debates and discussions in the field. 
Almost all (if not all) readings were presented by students in the class. Discussants would summarize the readings and facilitate the conversation by posing thought-provoking questions. This approach to going over the material was quite effective as it created an environment conducive to discussion and sharing. It also allowed me to understand other perspectives and other people’s approaches to dealing with the course materials. 

## Presentations
Each student in the course had to present an individual presentation on a topic related to the course themes. These presentations covered more modern material and through which we applied our findings from previous presentations, reading discussions, and our coursework. Presentations reflected people’s interests, and I particularly enjoyed talking about topics like cyborgs, emotional intelligence, and human/robot rights. 

## Final Outcome
For our final project, the professor suggested figuring out a way to put together all of the ecosystems we made for our midterm assignment. This project sounds very ambitious but also extremely exciting. The fact that we have been working through presenting a collective piece is a great representation of what this class has been about – learning together and building the material as we go! 

## Conclusion
Robota Psyche has generally offered students with a solid theoretical background for historical and contemproary issues and sub-issues relating to robotics, with the addition of technical and practical concepts and exercises. It's been great!
