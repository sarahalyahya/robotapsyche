# The Social Dilemma Reading Discussion - Sarah & Yiyang


## Overview
The material we covered was a documentary film called The Social Dilemma. It tackles the problems of lack of privacy and agency in a social media dominated world, including the destabilization and polaroization of the public that impacts people's mental health and their personal and collective lives.

We coordinated by watching the film separately and then having a call to debrief and discuss our own thoughts and questions. These thoughts and questions then culminated to create the presentation linked above. 

## Discussion

### Structure
- We started our presentation by summarizing the key points in the film and referencing quotes that highlight the dynamics between the social media algorithm (AI) and the users We then posed the first questions which covered the topics of agency and control.  
- We then delved into the separation of online identity and *real* social life and the responsibility we have and we should claim online. 
- Afterwards, we discussed regulation and other approaches to prevent abuse of users' private life and thoughts online. We tried to brainstorm with our classmates to find viable solutions to harm prevention. 
- Finally, we discussed whether this film explores its topic deeply enough to cover multiple contexts. We invited our classmates to share their own experiences with social media corporations in their home countries.

### Reflections 
- There was a general consensus among the class agreeing with the general premise of the movie, we noticed emotions of fear and concern sparked by this discussion through the thoughts shared by each individual and their answers to our first questions
- We noticed a few people sharing that they use social media for practical purposes (Facebook for university groups, for example) and then other peers shared their opinions about the algorithm "sucking us in" even if we're on these apps for pure objectives. 
- Ideas regarding regulation of social media use were brought up. We discussed Europe's GDPR briefly, and the professor introduced an idea put forth by another scholar in the field who suggested that these social media corporations should pay users for their data.
- We heard from our peers about social media platforms in their home countries (e.g, Kakao in South Korea).
