To be honest, I was hesitant to sign up for this class last semester. Although I am an IM major, I didnâ€™t feel like the topic of robotics has been that relevant in the context of my work outside the occasional article or artwork that I come across. Now, as the semester is coming to an end, I feel like this class has left me with a great sandbox of theoretical and practical concepts that I can use in the future. It also helped me better understand how crucial the conversations about the role of robots in our past, present, and future really are. In this summary, I will go over some of the concepts that stuck out to me and that I will probably revisit.
