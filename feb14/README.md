# Stronger Together

## Concept
As I read into predator-prey relationships, I couldn't help but apply them on a human context. The predator, an evil murderous dictator, and the preys, the people under this dictator's rule. This led me to think about the concepts of team work and collective effort. They say "We're stronger together," and I agree! So, I wanted to create an ecosystem where the predator grows less and less impactful as the preys gain strength from interacting -colliding - with each other. 

##The Cycle 
1. The Predator has the strongest presence in the system. Its attractive force is much stronger than the repelling force of the preys. This repelling force is meant to simulate attempts of escape 
2. As the preys are attracted towards the predator, they meet and collide with each other due to an attractive force between them. This makes them faster, stronger, and larger. 
3. Eventually, collisions with the predator do not kill the preys. They become insignificant. The preys as a collective just bounce off the predator and exist together peacefully. 

## Difficulties and Imperfections
Applying the impact of prey-prey collisions and prey-predator collisions was a bit challenging and depended a lot on trial and error. At first, I struggled with figuring out what to increment and what to keep untouched to achieve the effect that I want. I think I have more clarity about that now, but I still think the code needs more work to simulate a more well-connected physical system. For instance, I think the increase in prey radius should be more dependent on its mass increase rather than it independently increasing. Additionally, I tried to use scaling to make the process a bit slower, but I think it would look more organic if it was even slower.

## Next Steps
- Giving preys the ability to kill the predator
- Adding multiple predators
- Allowing for the "birth" of new preys


##Conclusion
This was a really fun assignment to work on! I have never coded with taking the laws of physics into account, and while it adds a challenge, it is so satisfying to create one's own mini-world, especially one where the members of the world can defeat evil and achieve justice :-)
