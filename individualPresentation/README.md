## Topic
Recently, I've been thinking a lot about accessibility to mental health resources, mainly how it is exclusive to a select few members of society, even when there's often a dire need for it. Early conversations in class inspired me to think about whether robots and AI can be a solution to this issue.  Then, as we started talking about ethics in robotics, I wondered how we can navigate that specifically when thinking about robots and mental health support. 

## Research Process 
I started my research and reading with chapters 6 and 7 in Joseph Weizenbaum's 'Computer Power and Human Reason,' which helped me build a  structure for my presentation. I decided to start with some brainstorming questions to start a conversation about what's needed to simulate a human mind, which Weizenbaum argued included a strong command of language. I then moved on to cover historical approaches to simulating the human mind, e.g. ELIZA, and tools to evalaute that simulation, i.e. The Turing Test. Conversations about ELIZA and PARRY bring up a lot of questions and skepticism with regards to ethics, including very valuable ones posed by Weizenbaum. I used this skeptcisim as my departure point to advocate for Robot "assisted" therapy. In this section, I covered CBT-trained chatbots like Woebot, and robotic support animals such as Paro. Finally, I concluded with some question that touch on bias, functionality, commercialization of mental health resource, and more. 

## Reflection
I really enjoyed the conversation and questions that came up during my presentation, and I found them to be a valuable addition to the reading discussion that came right after. I also found myself engrossed in this topic, trying out tools like Woebot. I will definitely keep tracking progress in this sub field of robotics, and I hope I inspired my classmates to do the same!
